{"name":"DIST","tagline":"direct imputation of summary statistics for unmeasured SNPs","body":"##What's New?\r\n**[07/14/2015]** Recently we developed a novel method/software for directly imputing summary statistics for unmeasured SNPs from mixed ethnicity cohorts ([DISTMIX](https://dleelab.github.io/distmix)). DISTMIX extends DIST capabilities to multi-ethnic cohorts analysis while 1) maintaining imputation accuracy and speed, 2) not requiring genetic data and 3) being applicable to pedigree data. A pre-compiled executable for DISTMIX (v0.2.0) built under Linux is available now!\r\n\r\n##Introduction\r\n\r\n\"DIST is a software program for directly imputing the normally distributed summary statistics of unmeasured SNPs in a GWAS/meta-analysis without first imputing subject level genotypes. This direct imputation of the normally distributed statistics (Z-scores) is achieved by employing the conditional expectation formula for multivariate normal variates and using the correlation structure from a relevant reference population (e.g., 1000 Genomes data set). When compared to genotype imputation methods, DIST i) requires only a fraction of their computational resources, ii) has comparable imputation accuracy for independent subjects and iii) is readily applicable to the imputation of association statistics coming from large pedigree data. Thus, DIST is useful for a fast imputation of summary results for i) studies of unrelated subjects which a) do not provide subject level genotypes or b) have a large size and ii) family association studies. DIST is written in C++ and can be easily used under Linux, Windows, MacOS etc.\" \r\n\r\n##Citing DIST\r\n\r\n**_DIST: Direct imputation of summary statistics for unmeasured SNPs_**,  Donghyung Lee; T.

The file contains six columns: 1) rsid, 2) chromosome number, 3) base pair position, 4) reference allele, 5) alternative allele and 6) normally distributed GWAS/meta-analysis summary statistic (Z-score). DIST does not require the input data to be sorted in ascending order by chromosome number and base pair position or rsid. The first line of the input file should be column names/headers. Data entries on each line should be separated by white space. Here is a sample DIST input file, with 5 SNPs:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrsid        chr  bp         a1  a2   z\r\n\r\nrs1000109   9    117908733  C   T   -0.714464\r\n\r\nrs10001109  4    44904653   C   T    0.721919\r\n\r\nrs1000112   22   28273339   C   G   -0.583666\r\n\r\nrs10001127  4    130547376  T   C    0.069329\r\n\r\nrs1000113   5    150240076  T   C   -1.447288\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note:** If the input data comes a different genome assembly (e.g. NCBI build 36 (hg18)) than NCBI build 37 (hg19), it needs to be converted to NCBI build 37 (hg19) using a software, called liftOver, from UCSC.    \r\n\r\n##DIST output file format\r\n\r\nThe DIST output file has ten columns: 1) rsid, 2) chromosome number, 3) base pair position, 4) reference allele, 5) alternative allele, 6) reference allele frequency, 7) Z-score, 8) DIST imputation information, 9) p-value and 10) type. The first line of the output file is column names/headers. The tenth column, type, contains 0, 1 or 2. 0 means the corresponding SNP is unmeasured (thus, imputed) one  but has been genotyped in the reference panel; 1 means the corresponding SNP is measured one and has been genotyped in the reference panel; 2 means the corresponding SNP is measured one but has not been genotyped in the reference panel. Here is a sample DIST output file, with 5 SNPs:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrsid        chr  bp     a1  a2  af1         z           info        pval      type\r\n\r\nrs74970982  1    61442  G   A   0.951444    0.00678502  0.252236    0.994586  0\r\n\r\nrs62637820  1    61920  A   G   0.0629921  -0.0502051   0.490445    0.959959  0\r\n\r\nrs76735897  1    61987  G   A   0.440945   -0.0614578   0.528252    0.950995  0\r\n\r\nrs77573425  1    61989  C   G   0.458005   -0.0552563   1           0.955934  1\r\n\r\nrs28599927  1    62271  G   A   NA         -0.0314447   1           0.974915  2\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Options\r\n\r\n|**Option**|**Short Flag**|**Parameter**|**Default**|**Description**|\r\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\r\n|--version|-v|none|none|Prints version information.|\r\n|--help|-h|none|none|Outputs a full description of all DIST options.|\r\n|--config|-f|filename|none|The configuration filename.

Thus, it is highly recommended to use the default setting for both options. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##Getting started with examples\r\n \r\nThe users are required to download a pre-compiled DIST executable (dist) and a sample input file (sample_input_chr22) from the **Download DIST** section above. A tgz-compressed directory with 1000 Genomes European or UK10K reference panel datasets also should be downloaded from **Download Reference Panels** section above and can be uncompressed using **tar** with the **-zxvf** options. Letâ€™s assume that the reference panel datasets named as \"chr#`_`foo.gz\" are stored in a directory /path/to/reference/.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Scenario 1:** We want to impute unmeasured SNPs on chromosome 22 in the sample input file and store all imputation results in a text file named as \"sample_output_chr22\".\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n>> ./dist -c 22 sample_input_chr22 -o sample_output_chr22 -r /path/to/reference/chr22_foo.gz\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Scenario 2:** Here, we want to impute unmeasured SNPs on chromosomes 11 in a GWAS/meta-analysis (assume the input file name is \"allchr_diabetes_hg19\".) and store the imputation results in a text file named as \"chr11_diabetes_hg19_imputed\". We want to set **the number of measured SNPs in the prediction window (num-pre)** to be 3 and **the number of measured SNPs in each side region of the extended window (num-ext)** to be 30.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n>> ./dist -c 11 -n 3 -m 30 -o chr11_diabetes_hg19_imputed -r /path/to/reference/chr11_foo.gz allchr_diabetes_hg19\r\n```\r\n \r\n\r\n**Scenario 3:** Let's assume that we use an input file (wtccc_scz) stored in a directory (/path/to/input/) and set **num-pre (n)** to be 2, **num-ext (m)** to be 60, **info-cutoff (i)** to be 0.90, **absz-cutoff (z)** to be 3.5 and **num-quant (q)** to be 5000 and keep using these settings. To run DIST with these settings, we should specify these options on the command line as follows:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n>> ./dist -n 2 -m 60 -i 0.90 -z 3.5 -q 5000 /path/to/input/wtccc_scz ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nLike the above example, entering frequently used options on the command line every time we run DIST is an irksome job. We can avoid this by specifying the options in a DIST configuration file, which is read by DIST at start-up. Here is a sample configuration file  containing all the options: \r\n\r\n```shell\r\nnum-pre = 2\r\nnum-ext = 60\r\ninfo-cutoff = 0.90\r\nabsz-cutoff = 3.5\r\nnum-quant = 5000\r\ninput-file = /path/to/input/wtccc_scz\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe named the above configuration file as \"config_wtccc.dst\" stored it in /path/to/config/. We can run DIST with the configuration file as follows:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n>> ./dist -f /path/to/config/config_wtccc.dst ...\r\n```  \r\n\r\nIf we want to impute missing SNPs on chromosome 7 in the input data file, we just specify the chromosome number option (c) to be 7:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n>> ./dist -f /path/to/config/config_wtccc.dst -c 7 -r /path/to/reference/chr7_foo.gz -o /path/to/output/chr7_foo_imputed\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo impute unmeasured SNPs on all autosomes (chromosomes 1-22) in the above input file at once, we can use a shell script (e.g. bash):\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\nfor i in {1..22}\r\ndo\r\n./dist -f /path/to/config/config_wtccc.dst -c $i -r /path/to/reference/chr$i_foo.gz -o /path/to/output/chr$i_foo_imputed\t\r\ndone\r\n```\r\n","google":"UA-43988260-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
